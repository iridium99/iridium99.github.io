## Visitor Widget

- Shows **All-Time** visits using CountAPI (`api.countapi.xyz`). Each page load increments the counter.
- Shows **Online Now** as an approximation by recording a heartbeat once per minute and displaying the current minute's count.
- No credentials or backend required; works on GitHub Pages.
- Note: "Online Now" is an estimate and may vary slightly depending on when visitors load the page within the current minute.
